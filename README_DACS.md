# Data Analytics Learning Curriculum

## Why I Created This

I'm starting my journey into data analytics and wanted a structured way to learn SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Python. 

Rather than jumping around between random tutorials, I decided to create a comprehensive learning path with clear progression from beginner to advanced concepts.

## The Thought Process

As a complete beginner, I knew I needed:

1. **Clear structure** - Not just "learn SQL" but specific assignments building on each other
2. **Real scenarios** - Actual business problems, not just "create table X"
3. **Measurable progress** - Success criteria so I know if I'm doing it right
4. **Skill progression** - Start simple, gradually increase complexity

So I worked with AI (Claude) to generate a complete curriculum of 450 assignments across all the major data analytics tools.

## What's Inside

- **SQL** (150 assignments): From basic SELECT queries to complex analytics
- **Excel** (150 assignments): Formulas, pivot tables, Power Query, VBA
- **Power BI** (50 assignments): Visualizations, DAX, dashboards
- **Python** (50 assignments): Pandas, data analysis, machine learning basics
- **Hybrid Projects** (50 assignments): Combining multiple tools for real-world scenarios

Each assignment includes:
- Business context and realistic scenario
- What tools/skills you'll learn
- Step-by-step tasks
- Success criteria
- Prerequisites (if it builds on previous work)

## Current Status

**Full transparency**: I haven't completed these yet. I'm a beginner creating this as my learning roadmap.

I'll be:
- Working through these assignments alongside my formal data analytics studies
- Updating this repo as I validate what works
- Fixing issues as I discover them

## How I'm Using This

1. Starting with SQL basics (Assignment #1)
2. Following the continuation chains for deeper learning
3. Supplementing my formal coursework with these hands-on projects
4. Building a portfolio as I complete assignments

## Files Included

- **Data_Analytics_Assignment_Tracker_COMPLETE.xlsx** - Main tracker with all 450 assignments organized by tool and difficulty
- **Data_Analytics_Restructured.md** - Detailed examples of the assignment format
- **RESTRUCTURING_SUMMARY.md** - Explanation of how the curriculum is organized

## A Note on the Excel File

GitHub can't preview multi-tab Excel files, so you'll need to download it to see all the organized sections. Each section (SQL Beginner, SQL Intermediate, etc.) is a separate tab.

## Why Share This?

Even though I'm a beginner, I'm sharing this because:
- Maybe it helps someone else starting their data analytics journey
- Open to feedback from experienced people on whether these assignments make sense
- Accountability - making my learning plan public keeps me committed
- If you're learning too, we can learn together

## Next Steps for Me

1. Complete my first 50 SQL assignments
2. Start my formal data analytics scholarship
3. Compare what I learn in the bootcamp vs this self-study
4. Update this curriculum based on real experience
5. Eventually share what actually worked

## Feedback Welcome

If you're experienced in data analytics and see issues with these assignments, I'd genuinely appreciate feedback. I'm learning!
